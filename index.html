                    This week's homeworks is about scrapping data from Wikis, which I scraped from page "Lantern Fesitval".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The date I scrapped was the Lantern Festival in China. As a Chinese, I ate Tangyuan at that night as it is one of the traditions in Chinese Culture. 
                </p>

                    The page <a id ="json" href="https://github.com/JingggZz/Week-3-Make-or-Scrape/blob/main/json/Lantern%20Festival.json"> here </a> is what I scraped and you can know some information about Lantern Festival from it.
