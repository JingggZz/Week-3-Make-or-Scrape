                This week's homeworks is about scrapping data from Wikis, which I scraped from page "Lantern Fesitval".

             <p>
                The date I scrapped was the Lantern Festival in China. As a Chinese, I ate Tangyuan at that night as it is one of the traditions in Chinese Culture.
